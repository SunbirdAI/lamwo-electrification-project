# Rank Minigrid Villages PUE

This folder contains machine learning scripts to rank villages for minigrid deployment based on Productive Use of Electricity (PUE) potential. It is part of the broader `predicting-minigrid-villages` repository under the Lamwo Electrification Project by [Sunbird AI](https://github.com/SunbirdAI).

## Folder Structure

1. **[`train_rank_minigrid_villages_PUE.ipynb`](#train-rank-minigrid-villages-pue)**  
   Trains a model to rank villages based on PUE potential using regression or ranking techniques.  
   [README](docs/train_rank_minigrid_villages_PUE.md)

2. **[`predict_rank_minigrid_villages_PUE.ipynb`](#predict-rank-minigrid-villages-pue)**  
   Predicts PUE-based rankings for villages to prioritize minigrid deployment.
